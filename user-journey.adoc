= User Journey with Pearlbee
Andr√© Walker <andre@andrewalker.net>

== Abstract

This document describes the different actors that interact with Pearlbee, and
what they expect to see and be able to do. It's meant for me to be a kind of
completion criteria as I develop the software.

== Actors

I'm mainly interested in four actors at this point:

- The Reader
- The Author
- The Site Administrator
- The Theme Developer

The rest of this document will go into detail of what each of those will be
able to do. In other words, what features the platform is expected to provide
each of them.

The journey is expressed in terms of a multi-user blogging installation, as my
goal is to use it for blogs.perl.org. It probably wouldn't be much different
for a single-user blog, only simpler.

Some possible users of the platform are not listed above, because they are not
my primary concern at the moment. They are still relevant and should be taken
into account as the platform matures. Some examples:

- Robots -- I'll just treat them as Readers for now, which is fine for an MVP,
  but will require more care later on.
- Extension Developers -- we will have to provide some sort of engine for
  extensions, but for now, I'll only offer a working core.

Probably some others, but let's begin with the list we're mostly concerned.

=== The Reader

A visitor comes to the homepage, they see a list of recent posts. For now, let's
say it's only sorted by date, most recent to oldest, among all authors. Only
some brief information is shown about every post: title, author, date it was
published and abstract. Clicking on the post takes the Reader to a page showing
the full post.

From the homepage, a search bar is visible where the user can search by keyword.
Somewhere else in the website, there should be a way to do an advanced search:
by author, by keyword, by date, by tag.

Still in the home page, it will be possible to click author names (from the list
of recent posts, at least), which will take the Reader to an author page. That
will be like the author's own blog: it will list their recent posts, an avatar,
a bio, links to social media, etc. It will not include a different layout
though, it will be consistent with the rest of the website.

That author page will also have an easy to remember URI, just "/:username". This
way it can be easily bookmarked or shared. It will likely be a common
entry point to the website, besides the homepage.

The Reader can also subscribe to RSS feeds for the entire blog (all the authors)
or for specific authors.

The Reader will be able to become an author by registering in the platform.
Every registered user will be able to write. Registering will provide no
additional features for readers at this point (there won't be a "follow" feature
as far as I can see). Not even comments, since it will be provided by a
third-party on a first moment (e.g. Disqus).

== The Author

As stated above, to become an Author, one would have to register on Pearlbee.
The process consists of filling out a short form, with email, username (only as
a handle for the URI) and password. The author would then need to verify the
email by clicking a link.

Now, when I say "Author" I'm actually grouping multiple actors together. As soon
as an Author gets registered, they are in fact an _Unconfirmed Author_. That
means they can write a post, but it won't be published right away. Some of the
other authors will have to _confirm_ that post, so that it is effectively
published. This is to avoid spam, since using CAPTCHA and verifying email are
not 100% effective.

To elaborate a little more: the Author submits the registration form, clicks
the link on their email, and writes a post. That Author can see the published
post, and so can other logged in Authors. But it is not publicly displayed on
the homepage, or for unauthenticated Readers. Only other Authors will see it in
their dashboards, possibly with a notification to ask them to confirm it is
real.

FIXME: Should everyone get a notification? Should there be a settings toggle per
user where they can subscribe by email for that? Or just show a small number
on a menu for users that are logged in, and don't tell anybody by email?

Once an Author is confirmed, they can write as many posts as they'd like. (We
should still have some DDoS protection though).

When an Author author logs into the dashboard, what they see is:

- a link to edit their _Profile_: avatar, bio, social media links. Change email
  (requires verifying again), and change password;
- a link to list their posts: there they can remove or edit them;
- a link to create a new post; there have been suggestions this should be the
  first page they see when they log in;
